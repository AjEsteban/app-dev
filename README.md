  1. A dogs way home
*Bella, as a puppy, finds her way into the arms of Lucas, a young man who provides her with a loving home. When Bella is separated from Lucas, she embarks on a 400-mile journey to reunite with her beloved owner. The orphaned mountain lion, a down-on-his-luck veteran, and some friendly strangers who happen to cross her path are all touched by the lost but spirited dog.*
  2. Midnight Sun
*Katie Price has been shielded from the sun since she was a child due to a rare genetic condition known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum. During the day, she is confined to her home, with only her father, Jack, and best friend, Morgan, to keep her company. Katie leaves the house every night when the sun isn't shining. While playing guitar at the train station one night, she is noticed and approached by her longtime crush, Charlie. Katie abruptly departs, leaving behind her notebook, which Charlie keeps. He returns the next day and hands it over to Katie when she arrives to retrieve it. Before kissing her on one of the boats, he explains how he got his injury, which prevented him from getting a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley.*
